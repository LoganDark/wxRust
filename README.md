# wxRust

wxRust aimed to be a project that provided convenient bindings to wxWidgets.

However, it's currently nonfunctional due to bugs in `bindgen`. Due to the sheer
size of wxWidgets, I can't just write hundreds of thousands of lines of FFI
definitions manually.

All I can do is wait, and hope that these bugs are fixed. If, one day,
`wxrust_sys` starts to compile, ping me on Discord and I'll start work on
wxRust. But until then, there can be no development.
